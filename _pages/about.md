Hello World! I'm a computer science student at UGA pursuing a certification in
Data Science! My interests relate to many aspects of machine learning, which
include supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. I want
to tackle many areas of application. Currently, I have ongoing projects in
domains such as NFL player performance, projecting cryptocurrency market
volatility, and poker strategy simulation. Please the GitHub repos for
associated code.

I began my journey into the Data Science realm almost three years ago
(time flies!) and started with very little programming experience. Now, with
one semester left to graduate, I've decided to start a blog to share my progress
and reflect on my time at UGA!
