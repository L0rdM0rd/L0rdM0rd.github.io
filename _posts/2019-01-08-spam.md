### Introduction

Spam detection is a classic Machine Learning exercise that presents a solid
introduction to classification. In this post, we will use some basic tools of
natural language processing for sentiment analysis of an SMS dataset from Kaggle.
These techniques should allow us to build a system which captures the semantics
of each text message and utilize supervised learning algorithms for performance
evaluation. Don't worry if you don't have background knowledge for some of these
keywords and concepts because we're going to start from scratch!

### Background

Given our set of text messages, the task is to determine whether each message is spam or not.
Our data is a combination of overlapping words/characters/symbols. As a result, our system
should learn from the patterns and frequencies of the data provided in the examples to establish a baseline for predictions. This can broken down into several stages. First, we need to convert our messages to an exhaustive vocabulary list. Then we will utilize some processing techniques to control fixed-effects such as part of speech, punctuation, capital letters, etc. This should produce a better signal for our model by reducing redundancy and noise from our vocabulary list. Finally, we will tune our model's parameters and evaluate it's performance on a new set of text messages. Let's get started!
