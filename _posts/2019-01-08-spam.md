### Introduction

Spam detection is a classic Machine Learning exercise that presents a solid
introduction to classification. In this post, we will use some basic tools of
natural language processing for sentiment analysis of an SMS dataset from Kaggle.
These techniques should allow us to build a system which captures the semantics
of each text message and utilize supervised learning algorithms for performance
evaluation. Don't worry if you don't have background knowledge for some of these
keywords and concepts because we're going to start from scratch!
