Hello World! My name is Justin Hooker and I'm a computer science student pursuing a BS with a certification in Data Science! I am graduating this spring (2019) and decided to start a blog to share my progress and reflect on my journey towards becoming a Data Scientist. This blog will provide me with an opportunity to articulate my understanding of some fundamental concepts related to machine learning.

My initial work was heavily focused on building projection systems, mainly for markets and sports. In fact, I have ongoing applications in daily fantasy for NFL and cryptocurrency prices. Recently, my time has been directed towards applications involving other learning frameworks. For example, I'm currently working on a poker strategy simulator using game theory and reinforcement learning. Feel free to reach out with any questions/comments and check out my GitHub for associated code.
