Hello World! I'm a computer science student at UGA pursuing a certification in Data Science! My interests relate to many aspects of machine learning, which include supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. I want to tackle many areas of application. Currently, I have ongoing projects in domains such as NFL player performance, projecting cryptocurrency market volatility, and poker strategy simulation. Please see the GitHub repositories for associated code.

I began my journey into the Data Science realm almost three years ago (time flies!) and started with very little programming experience. Now, with one semester left to graduate, I've decided to start a blog to share my progress and reflect on my time at UGA!
