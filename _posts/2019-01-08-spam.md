### Introduction

Spam detection is a classic exercise that presents a solid introduction to machine learning in practice. In this post, we will use some basic tools of natural language processing for sentiment analysis of an SMS dataset from Kaggle. These techniques should allow us to build a system which captures the semantics of each text message and utilize supervised learning algorithms for performance evaluation. Don't worry if you don't have the background for some of these techniques because we're going to build a spam detection system from scratch!

### Background

Given our set of text messages, the task is to determine whether each message is spam or not.
Our data is a combination of overlapping words/characters/symbols from each message. Our system should learn from the patterns and frequencies provided by the data to establish a baseline for predictions. This can be broken down into several stages.

First, we need to convert our messages into an exhaustive vocabulary list. Next, we will utilize some processing techniques to control for fixed-effects such as part of speech, punctuation, capital letters, etc. This should produce a better signal for our model by reducing redundancy and noise from our vocabulary list. Finally, we will convert our list into a vector where each character sequence has a corresponding index value.

If a message contains a given character sequence from our list, the corresponding vector index will contain a value of one and zero otherwise. We will effectively transform each message into a vector of ones and zeros indexed by character sequence. All together, the cumulation of these vectors will represent our feature matrix. We will feed this matrix into our algorithms and evaluate its performance. Let's get started!


### Stage One - Building the List

Alright, let's import our dataset and take care of some cleaning. We'll drop a few unnecessary columns, rename the ones we're keeping, and map 'ham' and 'spam' entries from our target to zeros and ones. Our final preprocessing step is to convert each text message into a list of character sequences, which is also known as tokenizing. All of this work can be done using two python libraries: pandas and nltk. The nltk package provides functionality specific to the natural language processing domain, while pandas is a general platform for data analysis. Let's have a look at the effect of tokenizing our dataset.
