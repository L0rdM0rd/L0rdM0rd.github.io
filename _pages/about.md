Hello World! I'm a computer science student at UGA pursuing a certification in
Data Science! My interests relate to many aspects of machine learning, which
include supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning.

I began my journey into the Data Science realm almost three years ago
(time flies!) and started with very little programming experience to draw from.
Now, with one semester left to graduate, I've decided to start a blog to share
my progress and reflect on my time at UGA!
