### Introduction

Spam detection is a classic Machine Learning exercise that presents a solid introduction to classification. In this post, we will use some basic tools of natural language processing for sentiment analysis of an SMS dataset from Kaggle. These techniques should allow us to build a system which captures the semantics of each text message and utilize supervised learning algorithms for performance evaluation. Don't worry if you don't have background knowledge for some of these keywords and concepts because we're going to start from scratch!

### Background

Given our set of text messages, the task is to determine whether each message is spam or not.
Our data is a combination of overlapping words/characters/symbols. As a result, our system
should learn from the patterns and frequencies of the data provided in the examples to establish a baseline for predictions. This can be broken down into several stages.

First, we need to convert our messages to an exhaustive vocabulary list. Next, we will utilize some processing techniques to control for fixed-effects such as part of speech, punctuation, capital letters, etc. This should produce a better signal for our model by reducing redundancy and noise from our vocabulary list. Finally, we will convert our list into a vector for each  message. If a message contains a string from our list, then a value of one will represent this string in the vector and zero otherwise. The cumulation of these vectors represent a matrix. We will feed this matrix to our algorithms for performance evaluation. Let's get started!
